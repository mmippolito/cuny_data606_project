possible research questions

Is there a correlation between number (or magnitude) of armed conflicts vs:
	number of bordering regions
	population density
	ethnic proportions
	type of government
	literacy rate
	gender makeup of state
	gender of leader
	increase over time
	increase at same rate as population
	increase by region vs population increase by region (and by world)

Hi everyone. Looking for some advice on how to handle missing values for my final project. I'm using two datasets, each with data collected over certain years. But some years are missing from each dataset--and not necessarily the same years. A made-up example to illustrate my point:

 year  stat1 stat2
1 2001 2000.1   2.1
2 2002 2000.2    NA
3 2003     NA   2.3
4 2004 2000.4   2.4
5 2005 2000.5    NA
6 2006 2000.6   2.6
7 2007     NA   2.7

My research question involves comparing stat1 vs stat2. My data is such that discarding NAs isn't really an option because that would leave no data for large portions of what I'm studying, so I've been playing around with various imputation techniques--single imputation so far, because multiple imputation sounds really hard. I'm wondering if there is a currently accepted approach I should be taking.

FWIW, neither stat is one that always grows or diminishes (like height might be), but can fluctuate over time--though not necessarily wildly so. I.e., in 2003, I'd expect the NA for stat1 to be within a few points of the previous and following years.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
